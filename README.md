This is The Hunt

The hunt is an app the fuses the good old fashioned scavenger hunt with the power of Foursquare, Rails and jQuery Mobile.

At this moment in time, you can only do a solo hunt.

Steps to use The Hunt:

1.$ git clone git@github.com:aimzatron/the_hunt.git

2.$ cd the_hunt

3.$ rails s

4. Go to http://localhost:3000!

I am working on getting this hosted and I will post the hosting information once it is done!

Enjoy your hunt, 
Aimee
